# Guess My Number

This project was my first project that I managed to solve alone, I found this challenge online and decided to replicate the game without looking at the solution.

In this game a random number is generated and the users needs to guess what number it is, the users guess is than compared to the random number and depending on the number guessed the logic returns a message to the users.

The application also keeps track of the users score, each time the users checks their guess it reduces their initial score of 20 by 1. There is also a high score feature which tracks the highest score achieved in the session.
